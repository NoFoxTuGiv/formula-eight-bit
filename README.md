## Design Goals

- Top down F1 game. Cars can only turn when moving forwards or backwards. The car should accelerate and decelerate smoothly.
- Controls for up to two players. Couch co-op style. Player 1 should be able to race against the clock or against another player.
- Minimum of four tracks (from a top-down perspective). [Watkins Glen, Monza, Mexico City, Suzuka]

## Stretch goals

- Random chance of rain which reduces grip.
- DRS system.
- AI to race against.
